    "Our report aims to focus itself around the `Divorce Predictors` dataset. The dataset itself consists of data coming from 150 Turkish couples; 84 divorced, and 86 currently married, who completed an assessment aimed at getting a basic understanding of the couple, and their relationship. The data has 170 instances, containing 54 predictors in the form of a written question. These predictors are then divided into a 0-5 scale (inclusive). \n",
